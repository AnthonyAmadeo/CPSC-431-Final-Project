A.	Individual project

B.	Create a musical Turing machine
		Goals:
			Implement a Turing machine in SuperCollider, either through a series of functions or by creating a Turing Machine class

			Feed a variety of computations into the Turing machine and sonify the process of a Turing machine computing the output.

			Research music-related computations and utilize the Turing machine to make transormations for musical data. Then sonify the result.

		Deliverables:
			Working code in the form of either a SuperCollider class or program
			Audio files of the various outputs

C.	Procedure
		Research how users have implemented Markov chains and Cellular Automata with the SuperCollider classes MarkovSet.sc, CALib, and cellular-automata-102917.scd.

		Research methods of realizing Turing machines. Construct a custom Turing machine class/program for SuperCollider.

		Aggregate a variety of instruction sets that can be used to inform a wide range of Turing machine computations.

		Generate outputs based on these instruction set, and design process for converting output into musical data. 

		If time allows, research music-specific computations and use this Turing machine to apply these computations to data representing musical inputs.

D.	Technical Requirements
		I don't think I will need access to any equipment besides the SuperCollider and the Internet.
